# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post on my new Astro-powered blog, deployed on **Cloudflare Workers**.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a fantastic framework for building content-focused websites:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Ships only the JS you need
- **Content Collections** - Type-safe content management
- **Markdown & MDX support** - Write content the way you want
- **Fast builds** - Optimized for performance

## Why Cloudflare Workers?

Deploying to Cloudflare Workers gives you:

1. Global edge deployment
2. Incredibly fast response times
3. Automatic scaling
4. Simple deployment with Wrangler

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about web development, Astro tips, and Cloudflare features!
