# Cloudflare Crushed Q4 FY25 — And I Couldn't Be More Pumped

If you haven't seen the numbers yet, let me save you a click: **we absolutely crushed it**.

Cloudflare just reported Q4 2025 earnings and the results speak for themselves — $614.5M in revenue (analysts expected $591.4M), $0.28 EPS (beating estimates by a cent), and shares jumping over 10% after hours. As a Solutions Engineer here, I get a front-row seat to the momentum driving these numbers, and trust me, the energy internally matches the results.

## The Deals Are Getting Bigger

Here's the stat that blew my mind: we closed our **largest annual contract value deal ever** in Q4, averaging $42.5 million per year. Total new ACV grew nearly **50% year-over-year** — our fastest growth rate since 2021. That's not just a number on a slide; that's the direct result of customers seeing real, tangible value in what we're building.

As someone who works with customers daily, I can tell you the conversations have shifted. It's no longer "why Cloudflare?" — it's "how fast can we get everything on Cloudflare?"

## Agentic AI Is Our Moment

Our CEO Matthew Prince put it perfectly:

> "The shift toward AI and agents represents a fundamental re-platforming of the Internet that's driving demand across Cloudflare's services. If agents are the new users of the web, Cloudflare is the platform they run on and the network they pass through."

This isn't hype. We're seeing it in real-time. Roughly **80% of the leading AI companies** already use Cloudflare's solutions. Between our inference network at the edge and the AI Workers development platform, we're positioned right at the center of the agentic AI wave. The excitement around our edge computing infrastructure — especially after the Clawbbot open-source AI agent buzz in late January — is very real.

## The Outlook Is Even Better

Looking ahead, guidance came in above expectations across the board:

- **Q1 2026 revenue**: $620–621M (consensus was $615.5M)
- **Full year 2026 revenue**: $2.79–2.80B (consensus was $2.74B)

We're not just beating expectations — we're raising the bar.

## Why This Matters to Me

Working at Cloudflare right now feels like being at the center of the internet's next chapter. Every day I help customers build faster, more secure, and more intelligent applications on our network. Seeing these results validated externally is incredibly motivating.

81 million HTTP requests per second. Millions of websites. And we're just getting started.

Here's to an even bigger 2026. 🚀
